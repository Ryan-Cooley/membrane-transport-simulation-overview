## Overview

This repository documents a **custom-force transport prototype** in OpenMM (Python interface) with VMD for inspection.  
The goal was to test whether particles could traverse a membrane-like barrier under a **downward driving force** while:
- keeping the membrane compact via **harmonic restraints**,
- **confining particles** within the simulation box,
- **blocking non-pore penetration** with a short-range repulsive wall near the membrane surface.

> **Note:** This prototype **does not implement explicit nonbonded interactions** (e.g., Lennard-Jones/Coulomb) or a full biomolecular force field. Temperature control was used to sustain motion and stabilize dynamics, but selectivity was governed by the custom forces and geometry‚Äînot by a calibrated force field.

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Design and implement** a membrane transport prototype
- **Establish** robust setup/troubleshooting protocols
- **Characterize** particle transport selectivity across membrane pores
- **Document** engineering decisions and troubleshooting approaches

## üî¨ Technical Approach (Accurate Summary)

**System Sketch**
- Membrane: simplified slab built from scratch (no lipid FF); compactness maintained using **harmonic restraints**.
- Particles: simple point masses (no bonded terms); a **spectrum of radii** and masses was explored (values redacted).
- Box/Boundaries: periodic or confining boundaries to keep particles in a defined region.

**Forces Used**
- **Downward drive** (pressure surrogate): a custom force pushing particles toward/through pores.
- **Membrane restraint**: harmonic restraint field to keep the slab compact and positioned.
- **Repulsive barrier near membrane**: custom short-range potential preventing transit **except through pores**.
- **No explicit LJ/Coulomb**: nonbonded interactions were not included in this prototype.

**Dynamics & Control**
- Integrator + **thermostat** (values redacted) to maintain a target temperature.
- Protocol: minimize ‚Üí equilibrate ‚Üí drive; frame cadence redacted.

**Diagnostics**
- Monitored **temperature**, **potential energy**, and qualitative trajectories in VMD.
- Checked mass‚Äìacceleration proportionality and boundary behavior.

## üìä Qualitative Findings

- Particles traversed the membrane **when pores were present** and drive was applied.
- Without pores, the **repulsive wall** blocked penetration as intended.
- Size selectivity was **limited** in this prototype because no explicit nonbonded potentials were used; behavior was dominated by geometry and custom forces.
- Membrane remained compact under harmonic restraint.

> Outcome: Did not reach the quantitative selectivity targets; prepared **next-step plan** for a successor to complete a physics-faithful model.

## üîÑ Next Steps (to make it physically meaningful)

1) **Introduce physical nonbonded interactions**
   - Add **WCA/Lennard-Jones** for sterics and optional **Coulomb** if charges matter.
   - Calibrate Œµ/œÉ (or WCA) to create radius-dependent exclusion realistically.

2) **Define the membrane potential surface**
   - Use an explicit atomistic slab or a **continuous potential field** for the wall/pore.
   - Parameterize pore radius and wall stiffness; sweep these systematically.

3) **Model the driving mechanism more faithfully**
   - Replace the global downward force with: concentration gradient, body-force density, or a **pressure differential** (barostat-compatible setup if applicable).

4) **Automate analysis**
   - Add a crossing detector (plane or cylindrical surface test) and log per-particle events.
   - Produce rate vs. radius curves; compute uncertainties via block averaging.

5) **Validation & stability**
   - Temperature/PE drift checks; timestep stability scans.
   - Compare toy results to known limits (e.g., hard-sphere sieving).

## üöÄ Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Force Field Balance
**Problem**: Balancing membrane stability with transport dynamics
**Solution**: Iterative refinement of restraint strengths and force scaling

### Challenge 2: Numerical Stability
**Problem**: Maintaining energy conservation and temperature control
**Solution**: Careful integrator selection and parameter tuning

### Challenge 3: Selective Transport Implementation
**Problem**: Particles showed uniform transport behavior regardless of size, lacking expected selectivity
**Solution**: Identified need for stronger size-dependent barriers and refined pore geometry design

### Challenge 4: System Size Optimization
**Problem**: Balancing computational cost with statistical significance
**Solution**: Systematic convergence studies and efficient sampling strategies
